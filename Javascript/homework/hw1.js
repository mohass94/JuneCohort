// q.1 Using string concatenation add two different strings together and print this off.

console.log("Hello " + "World!")

var firstWord = "Hello"
var secondWord = "World!"

//Another way of doing it.
console.log(firstWord + " " + secondWord)



//q.2 Using variables create a variable for a number, a string. Then print each of these variables.

var firstWord = "Hello"
var secondWord = 2

console.log(firstWord)
console.log(secondWord)  


/*q.3 Using string concatenation in javascript combine 3 different variables and prints it off. 
I.e variable for name age and date of birth will result in “my name is abdulkadir I am 24 years old and I was born in 1998”. 
(you cannot use name age and dob as your variables). I am somali I was born in qatar I live in San Diego*/

var ethnicity = "Somali"
var birthplace = "Qatar"
var home = "San Diego"

console.log("I am" , ethnicity, "I was born in" , birthplace, "I live in", home,)
